JavaFX Application Documentation
Overview
This JavaFX application demonstrates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) with a single button. When the button is clicked, it prints "Hello Core2Web" to the console.

Getting Started
Follow the steps below to run the application:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
Set up the JavaFX environment by either adding JavaFX libraries to the classpath or using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
Create a new Java class and copy the provided code into the class.
Code Description
Method: start(Stage primaryStage)
This method is the entry point of the JavaFX application. It initializes the graphical elements, sets up the user interface, and handles button events.

Parameters:
Stage primaryStage: Represents the main application window.
GUI Components:
Button c2w_btn: A JavaFX button that displays "Say 'Hello Core2Web'" as its label.
Event Handling:
When the button is clicked, an event handler is triggered, and the text "Hello Core2Web" is printed to the console.

Usage
Create a new instance of the Java class containing the provided code.
Launch the application by calling the launch method from the Application class.
java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
}
Example
Here's an example of how to use the provided JavaFX application:

java
Copy code
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import javafx.event.EventHandler;

public class HelloCore2WebApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        // Create the button and set its text
        Button c2w_btn = new Button();
        c2w_btn.setText("Say 'Hello Core2Web'");

        // Set up an event handler for the button click
        c2w_btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
                System.out.println("Hello Core2Web");
            }
        });

        // Create a layout container (StackPane) and add the button to it
        StackPane c2w_root = new StackPane();
        c2w_root.getChildren().add(c2w_btn);

        // Create a scene with the layout container as the root and set its dimensions
        Scene c2w_Scene = new Scene(c2w_root, 350, 250);

        // Set the title of the main application window
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello Core2Web");

        // Set the created scene as the main scene of the Stage
        primaryStage.setScene(c2w_Scene);

        // Display the main application window
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
Troubleshooting
If the application fails to run, ensure that you have set up the JavaFX environment correctly. Check the classpath and the JavaFX installation.
